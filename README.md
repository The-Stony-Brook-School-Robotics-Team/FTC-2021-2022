# FTC 2021-2022 SBS Bears Repo

This is the repository for the 2021-2022 First Tech Challenge!

Here, you'll see 3 different branches, as well as 4 different projects.
We used 3 different branches to manage the different code for each drivetrain that we 
used throughout the year.

The 4 projects that you can see under the projects tab allowed us to set tasks with respect 
for their person, helping manage our team's tasks
